# Insider Trading Analysis

Project on Analysis of Insider Trading Data using Form 4 Filings from the SEC Website

• Web scraped insider filing and stock price data from Form 4 filings from the U.S Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) website and the Yahoo Finance API respectively, using Python.

• Analysed in R, the aspects of insider trading such as how the trading behaviour of insiders changed over time or
by their position, as well as whether there was a correlation between insider trading and stock prices of the
company.

• Discovered that purchases made by insiders have a positive correlation with the stock prices of their company
